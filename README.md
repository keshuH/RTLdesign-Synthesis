Introduction to iverilog
What is a Simulator?
A simulator is an essential tool in digital design used to verify the functional correctness of a Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. It simulates the behavior of the hardware design described in Verilog, allowing you to check if it meets the required specifications before moving to more complex and costly stages of development. For this workshop, Icarus Verilog (iverilog) serves as the simulation tool.

Design and Testbench
Design: This is the Verilog code that describes the actual hardware's intended functionality. It's the core logic that will eventually be synthesized into a physical circuit.

Testbench: A separate Verilog module written to test the design. It generates a set of inputs, known as stimulus or test vectors, to check if the design behaves as expected under various conditions.

How the Simulator Works
A digital simulator is typically event-driven. It continuously monitors the input signals to the design. When it detects a change in the value of an input signal, it re-evaluates the design's logic to determine the new output values. If there are no changes to the inputs, the outputs remain constant, making the simulation process efficient.

Iverilog Based Simulation Flow
The process of simulating a Verilog design using iverilog generally follows these steps:

The Verilog Design and Testbench files are compiled together using the iverilog command.

This compilation step generates an executable file (by default, a.out).

Running this executable file performs the simulation.

The simulation produces a Value Change Dump (.vcd) file, which is a text file that logs all the signal value changes that occurred during the simulation.

This .vcd file can be loaded into a waveform viewer, such as GTKWave, to graphically analyze the behavior of the signals over time.

Lab 1: Setting up the Environment
The first lab session was dedicated to preparing the development environment. This involved creating the necessary directory structure for the workshop and cloning the required project files from a Git repository.

Lab 2: Working with iverilog and GTKWave
This lab provided hands-on experience with the iverilog simulation flow by simulating a 2-to-1 multiplexer (mux).

bash
./a.out
Executing this file runs the testbench, which applies stimuli to the mux design and generates a dump.vcd file containing the waveform data.

bash
gtkwave dump.vcd
This opens the GTKWave viewer, where you can load the .vcd file and visualize the waveforms of the inputs and outputs to verify the mux's functionality.

Mux Truth Table
The 2-to-1 multiplexer has two data inputs (i0, i1), a select line (sel), and a single output (y). The functionality is described by the following truth table:

sel	i0	i1	y (Output)
0	0	X	0
0	1	X	1
1	X	0	0
1	X	1	1
X denotes a "don't care" condition.

Introduction to Synthesis with Yosys
What is a Synthesizer?
A synthesizer is a tool that automates the process of converting a high-level hardware description (RTL) into a gate-level netlist. This netlist is a structural representation of the design in terms of primitive logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) and their interconnections. For this workshop, Yosys is the open-source synthesis tool used.

Verifying Synthesis
To ensure the synthesized netlist is functionally equivalent to the original RTL design, the same testbench used for RTL simulation can be used to simulate the netlist. If the synthesis was successful, the output waveforms from the netlist simulation should be identical to those from the RTL simulation for the same set of test vectors. A fundamental principle is that the primary inputs and outputs of the design remain unchanged after synthesis.

Logic Synthesis Explained
RTL Design: An abstract, behavioral representation of a digital circuit's desired functionality, typically written in an HDL like Verilog.

Synthesis: The process of translating this behavioral description into a concrete, structural implementation composed of interconnected logic gates from a specific technology library.

The Role of the .lib File
The .lib (Liberty) file is a technology library file that provides the synthesizer with a collection of standard cells available in a particular semiconductor manufacturing process. This library includes:

Basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).

Different "flavors" of each gate with varying performance characteristics (e.g., speed, power, area).

More complex combinational and sequential logic cells like multiplexers, adders, and flip-flops.

Why Different Flavors of Gates?
Standard cell libraries offer multiple versions of the same logic gate (e.g., a fast, a medium, and a slow 2-input NAND gate). These variations allow the synthesizer to make trade-offs between speed, power consumption, and area to meet the design's overall goals.

Timing Considerations
The maximum operating frequency (Fclk) of a digital circuit is constrained by the delay of its longest combinational logic path. The clock period (Tclk) must be long enough to accommodate the time it takes for a signal to propagate from one flip-flop to the next. This relationship is expressed by the formula:
T clk >T cq +T comb +T setup

T clk : Clock period.
T cq : Clock-to-Q delay of the launching flip-flop.
ùëá comb: Propagation delay through the combinational logic.
ùëásetup : Setup time of the capturing flip-flop.

To achieve a higher clock frequency (better performance), the total delay must be minimized.

The Need for Slow Cells
While fast cells are crucial for meeting performance targets (i.e., avoiding setup time violations on long paths), slow cells are also necessary. They are used on short paths to add delay and prevent hold time violations. A hold violation occurs when a signal changes too quickly after a clock edge, causing a flip-flop to capture unstable data. A well-designed library must contain a mix of fast and slow cells to satisfy both setup and hold timing requirements.

Faster vs. Slower Cells
The speed of a standard cell is determined by its ability to drive capacitive loads.

Faster Cells: These use larger (wider) transistors that can source or sink more current, allowing them to charge and discharge capacitances more quickly. This speed comes at the cost of increased silicon area and higher power consumption.

Slower Cells: These use smaller (narrower) transistors, resulting in lower area and power consumption but with a higher propagation delay.

Selection of Cells and Constraints
The synthesizer must be guided to select the appropriate cells to optimize the design. This guidance is provided through constraints, which are user-defined targets for timing, area, and power.

An over-reliance on fast cells can lead to a design that consumes too much power and area and may suffer from hold time violations.

Using too many slow cells can result in a circuit that is too slow to meet its performance goals.

Synthesis Illustration
The synthesizer takes Verilog code and implements it using the cells available in the .lib file. For instance, a Verilog module describing a flip-flop with a mux at its input:

verilog
module mux_ff (A, B, sel, clock, reset, Q);
  input A, B, sel, clock, reset;
  output reg Q;
  wire int_val;

  assign int_val = sel ? B : A;

  always @(posedge clock or posedge reset)
  begin
    if (reset)
      Q <= 1'b0;
    else
      Q <= int_val;
  end
endmodule
The synthesizer would translate this RTL code into a netlist containing instances of a multiplexer cell and a D-type flip-flop cell from the provided library.
